# Moksh Patel – Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and built from scratch without the use of website builders like Wix or Squarespace.
It showcases my background as a **Computer Science & Data Science student** and my work as a **future software engineer/developer**.

The website is inspired by the sleek and interactive designs of **Apple, Netflix, and Samsung** — featuring **scroll-based animations, 3D models, and modern UI/UX elements**.
